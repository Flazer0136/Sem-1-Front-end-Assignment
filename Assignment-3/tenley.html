        <h1>Tenley</h1>
        <p>Tenley is the cat most recently adopted into my home, and she was about a year old when I got her. She’s around 4 years old now – the time sure does fly. After I lost Maxwell, I volunteered at the local animal shelter to help all the kitties who didn’t have a home, and every morning when I walked into that room, she came up to me and was super affectionate and interested. I knew immediately: I would adopt this cat!</p>
        <p>She took no time to get adjusted to my home and is one of the sweetest cats I’ve ever met. She loves to cuddle and be petted, and never runs out of energy. Her favorite thing to do is carry her fishing rod around at 3AM and meow looking for attention.</p>
        <p>Her and Mona don’t get along extremely well, in part because of a clash of personalities. Tenley is very active and outgoing and full of energy, so with a more anxious cat, it just doesn’t work well. But overall, they’ve learned to co-exist without issue, so it’s fine.</p>
